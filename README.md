# ShinyThings says...

Quick and dirty index of ShinyThings' responses in the HWZ forum threads.

**Current position:** part 2's post 4877 to 6037

I don't intend to exhaustively catalogue every response in every single post.
Some are so specific or esoteric that it's nowhere near the F in FAQ.
Others are a bit how-to in operating SCB or IBKR.

Also, sometimes there are very interesting responses from BBCWatcher or tangent314 or other posters, you'll have to read the thread to find those.

If you have not, you should go buy the book from the [links on richbyretirementbook.com](http://richbyretirementbook.com/) which somehow just doesn't come up on a Google search.
It's currently USD 8 for the PDF/ePub on GumRoad, USD 10 for the Kindle version, and USD 20 for the paperback.
